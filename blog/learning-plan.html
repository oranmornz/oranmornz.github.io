        <h2>Sprint 2 - Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3>
            <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
        </h3>
            <p>
                My primary long-term goal is to be living and working as remotely as possible, using as full a range of my wider skill set as possible. I'm a fairly solitary person by nature, and thrive on domestic stability and routine. I do however easily stagnate without an engaging diversity of intellectual stimuli.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a few side quests. I'd like to earn a PhD, and spend some time working for a national institution like Radio NZ or Te Papa. I'd like to work on both software and hardware engineering in the audio/visual realm, and continue to evolve my application of my wider skill set in niche events.
            </p>
        <h3>
            <strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</strong>
        </h3>
            <p>
                A key strength I've long had is to be highly adaptable, and especially so when it comes to a new field of interest where my ADHD-fuelled hyper-focus may be effectively enabled, and supported.
            </p>
            <p>
                A very clear limitation is the inverse of that. My brain doesn't deal with learning well when there are what may consider as being 'mission-critical' threats to ones baseline stability. Unfortunately this is something that is typically ever-present to some degree.
            </p>
        <h3>
            <strong>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
        </h3>
            <p>
                I hope to be able to develop ones capacity for balancing out the aforementioned duality. My current life circumstances considered, I see my time here as a valuable opportunity to work on this.
            </p>
        <h3>
            <strong>What is your commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
            To endeavour to as best possible, structure and engage with ones workload as I may most effectively comprehend it. I have no doubts that I'll encounter many alien concepts and obstacles, and I've faith in my ability to find a suitable means of working through them both individually and collaboratively.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <strong>How you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives?</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Curious question. As a general rule for myself at present, I'm trying to piece back together the sense of routine and wellbeing that I'd developed for myself before suffering a string of reasonably serious injuries in recent years. Against all odds, I seem to be doing okay with this at present, so should things continue to stabilise and improve, all in my view should be productive, collaborative, and well.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Hopefully quickly identify when things are getting a bit much, and take proactive measures to self-regulate before ones brain gets carried away with it's long-held tradition of self-sabotage.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <strong>What is your commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Beyond reaching out to either our faciliators, or fellow students, I'm fortunate to have a number of friends with considerable experience in many areas of software development. I've no shortage of potential assistance where necessary, and generally I have no qualms with asking for help with whatever I'm working on. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            <strong>What do you expect from the facilitation team?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Good humour, useful pointers and insights, honesty, empathy and compassion, etc. I do not feel as though I have any concerns about the facilitation team lacking in such qualities, going off what experience I have with them thus far.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <strong>Do you have any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Nothing set in stone at this stage, however I do have semi-frequent medical errands and appointments that I usually try and schedule as uninvasively as possible. With my also exploring academic pursuits next year, it is also likely that I may have irregular appointments to be similarly scheduled as conveniently as one can.
