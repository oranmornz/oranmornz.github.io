        <h2>Foundations Reflections</h2>
        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
        <p>
            I don't feel as though I've learned anything new about myself/my ego, however it has highlighted a few things. Namely, that I still have a long way to go in my cerebral post-concussive recovery, but that I am still capable of what I knew I was beforehand, and that accessing that capability comfortably requires a lot more than I can yet readily sustain. It's a bittersweet highlighting, one might say..
        </p>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
            So many possible answers. I understand that the wider perspective around this is around principled collaboration, effective self-maintenance with respects to ones physical, psychological, and emotional beings, and an ability to identify ones limitations through a compassionate lens related to the aforementioned point around self-maintenance.
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
        <p>
            Truthfully, it wasn't a surprise but a highlight, in that I'm burned out on human skills in general. I've spent the better part of the past 10-12 years trying to undo the mess of a life I've had, and despite the progress yeilded, I'm extremely worn out on it and the amounted costs of it in other areas of life. I say this whilst being acutely aware of it being a never-ending task, and I can identify many areas where there's still considerable work to be done. I can also however identify that those areas will not be resolved during my time here. That's okay. I knew what life parameters I signed up for by taking this on, and how much space it'd take up. Knowing that does't make it any easier however, and neither does knowing that they will take many years to work through.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
        <p>
            Single aspect - feeling emotionally engaged in it.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
            I understand it as being an acknowledgement of the fact that technical skills are only a fraction of what's involved in succeeding in the tech industry.
        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
            Not a waste of time, no. I am acutely aware of the general and overall value of it. For me though, at this time, it is an added load on my emotional state that I would prefer not to have. I do not feel comfortable justifying that further, and I feel that my previous points/responses affirm that well enough.
