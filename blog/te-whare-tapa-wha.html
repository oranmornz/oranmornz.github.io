            Te Whare Tapa Whā
        </h2>
       <h3>
        Taha Tinana
       </h3>
       <p>
        Maintain stable and balanced diet, primarily plant based. Maintain medication and skincare routines, and as healthy and stable a pattern of sleep and wakening as possible.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Taha Hinengaro
       </h3>
       <p>
        I try to maintain an emotionally balanced state through a few means. Often it's through a quasi-meditative state with music that I connect with, other times it's taking time out to find quietude in natural surroundings.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Taha Wairua
       </h3>
       <p>
        I maintain routine spiritual practices of sorts. I have been a practicing astrologer for fifteen or so years, and routinely take time out to 'talk to the trees,' so to speak. I maintain a close connection with the natural world, it's flora and fauna.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Taha Whānau
       </h3>
       <p>
        I do not have a particularly close relationship with my remaining biological family, but have a god-daughter, whose mother is among a few I consider as being my chosen family. I remain in touch with her most days, as I do those of comparable closeness.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Whenua
       </h3>
       <p>
        As already stated, I try to maintain a fairly close relationship with the natural environment. It's important to me to be able to spend time in forested areas, preferably abundant in bird life. Where possible I try to spend time near the ocean, or some other body of water. Anywhere I may find a balance of the elements.
